            </h3>
            <p>
              I worked with Heal's design and e-com teams on this project. Our goal was to create a more user-centric
              design that facilitates product discovery and encourages users
              discover and explore products more effectively, leading to increased engagement and conversions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="projects">Design Goals </h3>
            <p>
              The redesign should follow brand design guidelines and styles. The design should be easy to use
              and accessible to people with a range of technical abilities.
            </p>
            <h3 class="projects">Tools </h3>
            <p>
              I used Figma and Photoshop for this project.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I conducted initial research by leveraging Google Analytics to gain insights into the audience
              demographics
              and behaviors on Heal's website.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used Google Analytics data to identify and select user interview participants, ensuring a diverse
              representation of the target audience. I conducted in-depth interviews with a total of six participants
              whose interests aligned closely with the findings from Google Analytics. The participants encompassed a
              range of profiles, including Green Living Enthusiasts, Cooking Enthusiasts/30 Minute Chefs, Value
              Shoppers, Health & Fitness Buffs, Home Decor Enthusiasts, and Avid News Readers as well as users with an
              interest in

            User Interviews
          </h3>
          <p>
            I conducted in-person interviews with selected participants and facilitated a task-based activity
            where users were asked to locate and add a sofa of their choice to
            the shopping basket. This hands-on approach allowed for a deeper understanding of user preferences,
            decision-making processes, and potential pain points in the product search and selection journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            The task-based activity involved participants using both desktop and
            mobile devices. By using multiple devices, it enabled the observation of user
            interactions, preferences, and potential usability issues across different screen sizes and interaction
            contexts.

            Personas

          <p>
            As part of my design process, I developed 2 personas to help me better understand and empathise with the
            target audience. I created detailed profiles and during user interviews I was
            able to gain valuable insights into their expectations, concerns, motivations, and behaviours. It helped
            me to keep the user's needs and
            goals at the forefront of my thinking.

            Key Findings
          </h3>
          <p>
            User interviews uncovered notable issues particularly around product images, shipping information, and
            financing details. Additionally, several other
            problems arose in the sessions that hindered users. These will be elaborated on in the following sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the interviews exposed considerable pain points across key aspects of the experience. Addressing
            these through design interventions will better serve user needs uncovered through the research.
          </p>
          <h3 class="challenge">
            Analysis
          </h3>
          <p>
            The analysis of the page was conducted by applying the Baymard Institute's heuristics, a well-established
            set of principles and guidelines for evaluating and improving user experience. By leveraging these
            heuristics, the assessment aimed to identify potential usability issues and areas for enhancement,
            ultimately ensuring a more user-centered and effective design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I based the product page analysis on Mistral 3 seater sofa product page, one of the
            bestselling products.

            Product Images
          </h3>
          <p>
            As a crucial aspect of the user experience, the analysis began with an evaluation of the
            product images featured on the Mistral 3 seater sofa product page. I aimed to assess the
            quality, presentation of the images to determine their effectiveness in showcasing the
            product to potential customers. By carefully scrutinizing the product images, we sought to identify
            opportunities for improvement to provide users with a more comprehensive and visually engaging
            representation of the
            sofa.

          </br>
          <p>
         
          <p>
            According to Baymard Institute research, high-resolution product images significantly impact user confidence. 
            Sites with consistently high-quality images feel more polished and professional, 
            with 56% of users immediately exploring product images upon page arrival.

          <h3 class="projects">Redesigned Product Image Section </h3>
          <br>
          <p>However there were the following opportunities to better align with UX best practices:</p>
          <ol class="interview">
            <li>
              The usability testing showed that users struggled to find or never found the truncated thumbnail
              images
              when presented in a
              manual carousel below the main image. To improve, I decided to make all the
              product thumbnail images visible on the product page both on mobile and desktop.
              This aligns with conventions that clicking an image will enlarge or show more. Showing all thumbnails
              directly supports the user's product evaluation
              goals by providing easy access to visual information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently, the number of supporting images varies inconsistently across product variations.
              To better meet user needs, the redesign will standardise the image gallery across variations. Each
              product
              will include: a lifetstyle, 360 degree video, 5 of cut-out images and an image with detailed
              dimensions.
              Standardising image types and quantities will provide users consistent and complete visual information
              to
              compare and evaluate products effectively. This supports the key goal identified in research of
              enabling
              informed purchase decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The current product images are not large or high-resolution enough for detailed
              visual inspection. This hinders users' ability to evaluate the products effectively. Additionally, the
              only zoom feature is click-based which lacks discoverability.
              The redesign will incorporate larger, higher resolution product images, in addition to click-based
              zoom
              the cursor will change into magnifying glass on hover.

          <p>The below practices are adhered to or mostly adhered to on the current product page and ensure a
            comprehensive and engaging visual experience, enabling users to make informed decisions and establish a

          </p>
          <ol class="interview">
            <li>
              The product price was below the fold, lacking visibility. In some
              tests users were not sure how much the total price was in selected fabric option. Tests also showed that
              users expected a pop up when product was added to basket with total price visible once added to basket.
              To address these issues the redesign incorporates total pricing reflecting custom configurations placed
              more visibly above the fold. I also added the price as a hover over to add to basket button. Confirmation
              popup was also added with total price visible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Heal's site offers a save feature, but it requires creating an account. There is no visibility into
              how long
              items are saved for. Requiring an account creates friction and abandonment. Allowing guest users to save
              items would better align with user needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users noticed that financing options lacked discoverability. Making this more prominent will expand
              purchase accessibility. I
              created 0% Credit button under 'Add to basket' to increase visibility of financing that sits above the
              fold.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also observed that the option to order fabric swatches was not discoverable due to poor placement. To
              address this, the redesign prominently surfaces swatch ordering in multiple locations - in the fabric
              dropdown, product info section, and at the bottom of the page.
              Filtering by a particular fabric type was also missing from the fabric selection menu. Keeping our persona
              Betty in mind I thought it would be useful to add information about Martindale Rub count as well as create
              filters for Family Friendly fabrics or Spill Resistant ones. I also added filtering by colour makign
              fabric
              search easier. And finally, adding a filtering option with Mark's persona sustainability pain point in
              mind.
            </li>
            <li>
              Product variations are interlinked, except for size options. Redesign incudes interlinking different sofa
              sizes for a more unified experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fabric and feet options did not expand together. This caused confusion when
              feet needed to be selected before adding to cart. Expanding both customisation menus together will
              increase clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are 360 and cut-out images for variations, however cut-out images are not updated when different
              fabric is selected
              change. I propose to have dynamically updated cut out images when users selects a different fabric option
              for more consistent experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heal's has physical stores and sells large, expensive products. However, "Find In Store" or "Click and
              Collect" options are not visible in the purchase section. I added "See In Store" link under add to cart
              butting in the buy section to allow
              users to conveniently view products in stores when needed.
              Omnichannel integration provides flexibility and convenience when acquiring products.

            Shipping and Returns
          </h3>
          <p>
            User research revealed issues with shipping information discoverability and transparency:
            users struggled to find shipping costs and details. They expected this information placed more visibly near
            the add to cart button.
          </p>
          <p>
            One user called the "hassle-free returns" not truly hassle-free, saying it should transparently indicate
            upfront that change of heart returns incur a charge, remarking: "it's not even that expensive - would like
            to see it straight away".
          </p>
          <p>
            To better meet user needs around shipping transparency, redesign surfaced shipping cost and policy
            information prominently near add to cart.
            As well as clearly indicating any associated charges for returns due to change of heart.
            To improve visibility of shipping details I also moved it up the page and placed together with prodcut
            details information.

          <ol class="interview">
            <li>
              Users searched for reviews but few products currently have them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review submission requires creating an account and asks for personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              No distribution summary is shown, depriving users of quantitatively interpreting reviews.
              <p>
    
               Baymard Institute research found that 90% of users rely on ratings distribution summaries to evaluate products, 
               using them more than the reviews themselves.
            
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Distribution summaries lack clickable star groupings to filter.
              <p>
                Edward Scott also points out:
              <blockquote>
                Furthermore, of those sites that do provide their users with a ratings distribution summary, 40%
                don't
                allow users to click the different star groupings, directly breaking a strong user expectation of
                the
                summary also acting as a “star ratings” filter. Product ratings distribution summary at the top of
                the
                reviews section allowed users during testing to get a feel for how the product has been rated
                overall.
                In fact, the ratings distribution UI was the most utilised feature of the reviews section, and was
                relied on by users even more than the actual review content.

              Heal's currently does not respond to any negative reviews. This could leave users doubtful of customer

          <p>
            I used Colour Contrast Analyser app to ensure that there is an adequate contrast between elements
            within the website. This helps users with low vision or those in different lighting conditions to
            effectively use
            the website. I tested not only the text but also various UI elements to make sure it was legible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used off-white colour from Heal's brand pallette as a background. Research suggests that less contrast
            in
            the case of black text on white background as well as
            white
            text on black background works better for accessibility as it reduces strain on the eyes
