              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              While I was familiar with the subject before conducting user interviews, I wanted to gain a deeper
              understanding of the topic and the existing products on the market. Research has shown the significant
              impact of agriculture on climate change, which motivated me to delve deeper into the subject.
              <br>
              Amanda Schupak who writes for The Guardian emphasises the importance of transitioning to sustainable,
              low-emissions diets, even if not fully vegan:
            <blockquote>
              "What we eat has an enormous environmental impact. Scientists estimate that food production causes 35%
              of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, with meat responsible for more than twice the pollution of
              fruits, grains and greens. In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report urged
              world leaders, especially those in developed countries, to support a transition to sustainable, healthy,
              low-emissions diets to help mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              A study by Marco Springmann suggests that transitioning to plant-based diets could reduce global mortality
              and food-related greenhouse gas emissions:
            <blockquote>
              "Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could
              reduce global mortality by 6-10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29-70% compared with a
              reference scenario in 2050."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              The above quotes emphasise the urgency of making changes to our food system to address the interconnected
              issues of climate change, health, and ecosystem degradation. The research highlighted the significant
              impact
              of food
              production and consumption on the environment and human health.
            </p>

              User Interviews
            </h3>

            <p>
              Given that the subject of veganism can be sensitive, I felt that interviews would allow me to ask
              follow-up questions and gain a more in-depth understanding of the audience's motivations and needs.
              I conducted semi-structured interviews both with vegans and people who are just curious about the subject.
              I selected a set of pre-determined topics that I knew would be relevant to my project, but also allowed
              for flexibility to explore new avenues and follow-up questions as they arose adapting to each person. The
              interviews provided me with a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in designing
              a successful vegan app.

              I used the following questions as a basis of the interviews.
            </p>
            <ol class="interview">
              <li>
                Motivations/ inspiration for considering vegan diet? If vegan motivation for staying vegan and
                inspiration

              <li>

                Do they currently keep track of nutrition and food intake?

              <li>
                How do they discover new recipes?

              <li>
                What are your biggest concerns when it comes to vegan nutrition?
              </li>
              <li>
                What apps do they use to that are related to the diet?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is missing from their routines that an app could help with?
              </li>

            Personas
          </h3>
          <p>
            As part of my design process, I developed 2 personas to help me better understand and empathise with the
            target audience for the app. I wanted to target both people already familiar with the vegan lifestyle
            and
            users who are just considering to switch. I created detailed profiles and during user interviews I was
            able to gain valuable insights into their expectations, concerns, motivations, and behaviours. Valeria
            and
            Patrick served as a guide for the rest of the design process, helping me to keep the user's needs and
            goals at the forefront of my thinking.

            Key Findings
          </h3>
          <p>
            During the interviews it became clear that people really struggled with the luck of nutritional
            education when it came to the vegan diet. As one participant pointed out, "I almost had to become a
            nutritionist." People who were not yet vegan were concerned that their health would be impacted due to the
            lack of knowledge, with one saying, "it is too difficult, and I would struggle to eat well."
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            While people had some knowledge of the vegan lifestyle and its environmental impact, it seemed that they
            didn't just want another recipe app, as people who were vegan were following influencers on Instagram and
            getting inspiration there, and omnivores had a few tried and tested recipes they cooked. Instead, what
            people needed was a nutritional coach that also knew how to cook well. In response to these findings, the
            initial product idea was adjusted to better accommodate the need for nutritional education and support.

            Competitive Analysis
          </h3>
          <p>
            I identified companies and products
            that are currently on the market and are aiming to help the transitioning to a vegan diet. I wanted to gain
            insights into existing solutions that aim to make the transition
            process more seamless and convenient.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assess the strengths and weaknesses of my competitors I compared
            their content, functionality, and overall user experience. I also looked into user reviews on the app store.
            This exercise enabled me to pinpoint areas of
            improvement and identify potential gaps in the market that my app could address effectively.

            Problem Statement
          </h3>
          <p>
            A well-crafted problem statement will help me guide the design process by providing a clear and focused
            objective to work towards, while also addressing the needs and pain points of the target audience:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Many people tend to struggle to transition to a vegan lifestyle due to a lack of knowledge, resources, and
            support. My goal is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly app that provides guidance, education, and
            motivation to help users successfully adopt and most importantly maintain a vegan lifestyle in the long
            run."

            Affinity Map
          </p>
          <p>
            I used affinity map as a visual tool for brainstorming and organising information. It helped me to make
            sense of the data gathered in research, insights from the interviews, and ideas by grouping related concepts
            or themes together to come up with solutions and features for my target audience. The process involved
            capturing pain points or insights from the user interviews and then organising them based on their natural
            relationships or a common theme.

            Features prioritisation
          </h3>
          <p>
            After conducting research, interviews and analysis, I developed a comprehensive list of solutions and
            features tailored to address the pain points identified among the target audience. Throughout this process,
            I referenced the personas I had previously created to ensure alignment with their needs and preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prioritise the features, I utilised a chart that considered the potential impact and level of effort
            required for implementation. Emphasising high impact and low effort, as well as high impact and high effort,
            took precedence over features with low impact and high effort.

          <p>
            During the course of this case study, an exciting development emerged with the introduction of ChatGPT, an
            advanced AI assistant. This breakthrough created an opportunity to enhance the app by incorporating a vegan
            AI
            assistant capable of answering user queries regarding nutrition, supplementation, recipe suggestions, and
            providing guidance throughout their transition to a vegan diet. An integration with ChatGPT or a similar LLM
            is a resource that would allow to address user's inquiries comprehensively.
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Based on my persona's needs, pain points, and motivations, I proceeded to develop high-fidelity wireframes.
            The initial focus was on the sign-up process, aiming to create a user-friendly and comprehensive experience.
            This would allow users to create personalised plans based on their fitness goals, dietary restrictions, food
            preferences, dislikes, as well as important factors like gender, age, and activity levels. Different levels
            of cooking were taken into account to accomodate different abilities
            for Patrick and Valeria. The goal was to
            gather detailed information to ensure the app could provide tailored recommendations and support for each
            user persona's needs.

            Meal Planner
          </h3>
          <p>
            I then created a comprehensive meal planning feature for the app.
            This included a diverse range of recipes, a convenient pantry section that allowes users to input
            ingredients through voice commands, and intuitive search filters to cater to individual dietary needs.
            Additionally, I added a scheduling functionality, enabling users to easily integrate the
            meal plans into their personal calendars. These features were designed to enhance user convenience and
            provide a seamless experience in meal planning and organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app's robust filtering system empowers Patrick to select a meal that perfectly suits his special
            occasion, ensuring a memorable dining experience. On the other hand, Valeria can effortlessly identify the
            most nutritious options that align with her dietary preferences and goals. The app enables users to make the
            most of their pantry ingredients, minimising food waste and promoting
            sustainability. Taking it a step further, the integration of an AI assistant will provide invaluable support
            by addressing any vegan lifestyle-related queries, offering personalised guidance and enhancing the overall
            user experience.

            AI Assistant
          </h3>
          <p>
            AI assistant functionality is based on the recent developments in language models such as chatGPT.
            It will assist in a variety of ways. Users can ask the AI assistant for vegan recipe ideas based on specific
            ingredients,
            dietary preferences, or cuisines. It will generate recipe recommendations and provide detailed
            instructions.
            Users will be able to inquire about the nutritional content of various foods, such as
            protein, vitamins, or minerals which will be helpful to both Valeria and Patrick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patricks can also ask the AI assistant for vegan substitutes for his favourite non-vegan ingredients in
            his favourite recipes to help with his transition. The AI can also offer guidance on how to achieve similar
            flavours and textures. It can offer cooking tips and techniques specifically tailored to
            vegan cooking, as well as user's cooking expertise level making it easier for someone who is just switching
            to vegan lifestyle.
            Users are able to get advice and guidance on various aspects of the lifestyle:
            ethical considerations, environmental impact, plant-based nutrition all
            within the app.

            Grocery Shopping
          </h3>
          <p>
            I wanted to integrate groccery shopping within the app to allows users to seamlessly add ingredients from
            their
            meal plans to their shopping list. This integration ensures a smooth transition from planning meals to
            purchasing the necessary items.
            It also helps users keep track of their pantry and refrigerator
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on initial user interviews, I have designed a flexible grocery shopping list feature where the
            quantities of items can be
            easily adjusted according to their needs. Additional items can also be easily added in an online store.

            Users can adjust the recipe quantities based on the number of servings they need. Users are able to provide
            ratings and save favourite recipes.

            I wanted to enable users to track their nutrients intake, including macronutrients (such as carbohydrates,
            proteins, and fats) and micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals.
            The nutritional breakdown is provided for each meal as well as the summary of the user's overall nutrient
            intake.
            I decided to integrate a barcode scanner functionality that allows users to add any additional foods. This
            feature can automatically retrieve nutritional information from a database.
            Users will also be able to customise and create recipes from scratch. Provided visual representations offer
            insights based on their tracked data to help users make informed
            decisions about their dietary choices this feature in works in conjunction with AI assistant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on initial user interviews I also included a feature to track daily water intake, encouraging users to
            stay hydrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food tracker can be synced with wearable devices or other health apps to gather additional data, such as
            calorie expenditure or physical activity, for a more comprehensive overview of the user's health and

            Impact Calculator

            To encourage users to stay on track I wanted to provide environmental impact information. Such as
            litres of water saved, carbon footprint calculation, deforestation impact analysis, amount of grains saved
            and of course animal lives saved.

            User Testing

            After completing the prototype, I proceeded with user testing, choosing four
            individuals from the previous participant list who closely matched the characteristics of my personas.
            I conducted interviews and observations with two individuals, implemented the necessary changes based on
            their feedback, and then interviewed the remaining two participants using the updated prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the testing session, I posed the following questions:
          <ol>
            <li>What are your initial impressions of the app's design and user interface? I observed if it was easy to
              navigate and asked if anything stands out positively or negatively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Can you describe your experience using the app? Were you able to understand and use the app's features
              easily?
            </li>
            <li> Were there any aspects of the app that you found confusing or difficult to use?
              I also asked about specific functionality and if it was useful such as meal planning and using AI
              assistant and observed users perform a task.
            </li>
            <li> Does the app address your needs and expectations as someone who is vegan or is considering vegan diet?
              Are
              there any key features or functionalities missing that you would like to see in the app?

            <li>Were you able to accomplish your intended tasks or goals using the app? How would you rate your
              overall
              satisfaction with the app and its functionality?</li>
            <li>Are there any specific pain points or areas that you think could be enhanced?</li>

            Iterations

          <p>
            I made the followign changes to the initial design based on conducted user tests:
          <ol>
            <li>Based on feedback, I made adjustments to the initial design placement of the barcode scanner, voice
              input, and search bar. Initially, they were positioned at the top of the screen, but I moved them down to
              better accommodate user preferences and improve usability: "it's uncomforbotable having to reach for the
              top of the screen".
            </li>
            <li>
              I incorporated back buttons into my designs, particularly in the sign-up process, as I noticed that users
              lacked the ability to revise their choices.
            </li>
            <li> I also added intermittent fasting as a dieting option and separated recepies by breakfast, lunch and
              dinner categories based on user feedback.
            </li>
            <li> The pantry step of the journey needed some additional instructions initially.
            </li>
            <li>
              To address some confusion, I took the feedback into account and renamed the buttons in the
              "create a meal plan" journey. This helped provide clearer indications of each step's purpose,
              making it easier for users to navigate through the prototype.

            Accessibility

          <p>
            I used Colour Contrast Analyser app to ensure that there is an adequate contrast between elements within the
            website. This helps users with low vision or those in different lighting conditions to effectively use the
            app. I tested not only the text but also various UI elements to make sure it was legible.

          </p>
          <p>
            I used off-white colour as a background and not completely black but black with a touch of grey blue for
            text. Research suggests that less contrast in the case of black text on white background as well as white
            text on black background works better for accessibility as it reduces strain on the eyes
          </p>
          <p>
            To insure icons in the menu are large enough and easy to click I used frames that are at least 44x44px
            according to WCAG 2.1.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make sure the pages were legible for people who are colour blind I used a Figma plugin.
