            <!-- <p>
              While I was familiar with the subject before conducting user interviews, I wanted to gain a deeper
              understanding of the topic and the existing products on the market. Research has shown the significant
              impact of agriculture on climate change, which motivated me to delve deeper into the subject.
              <br>
              Amanda Schupak who writes for The Guardian emphasises the importance of transitioning to sustainable,
              low-emissions diets, even if not fully vegan:
            <blockquote>
              "What we eat has an enormous environmental impact. Scientists estimate that food production causes 35%
              of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, with meat responsible for more than twice the pollution of
              fruits, grains and greens. In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report urged
              world leaders, especially those in developed countries, to support a transition to sustainable, healthy,
              low-emissions diets to help mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              A study by Marco Springmann suggests that transitioning to plant-based diets could reduce global mortality
              and food-related greenhouse gas emissions:
            <blockquote>
              "Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could
              reduce global mortality by 6-10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29-70% compared with a
              reference scenario in 2050."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              The above quotes emphasise the urgency of making changes to our food system to address the interconnected
              issues of climate change, health, and ecosystem degradation. The research highlighted the significant
              impact
              of food
              production and consumption on the environment and human health.

              User Interviews
            </h3>

            <p>
             I conducted interviews with 8 participants - 4 existing vegans and 4 considering the switch. 
             The key finding shifted my entire approach: people weren't struggling with finding recipes 
             (Instagram provided endless inspiration). 
             Instead, they lacked confidence in nutritional adequacy. 
             As one participant noted, "I almost had to become a nutritionist."</p><br>

<p><strong>Key insight: </strong>
Users needed a nutritional coach that could also cook, not another recipe app.</p>

              <!-- I used the following questions as a basis of the interviews.
            </p>

            As part of my design process, I developed 2 personas to help me better understand and empathise with the
            target audience for the app. Valeria - a long-term vegan focused on optimal nutrition 
            and athletic performance, and Patrick - an aspiring vegan concerned about health impacts and ease of transition.

            Key Findings
          </h3>
          <p>
            During the interviews it became clear that people really struggled with the luck of nutritional
            education when it came to the vegan diet. As one participant pointed out, "I almost had to become a
            nutritionist." People who were not yet vegan were concerned that their health would be impacted due to the
            lack of knowledge, with one saying, "it is too difficult, and I would struggle to eat well."
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            While people had some knowledge of the vegan lifestyle and its environmental impact, it seemed that they
            didn't just want another recipe app, as people who were vegan were following influencers on Instagram and
            getting inspiration there, and omnivores had a few tried and tested recipes they cooked. Instead, what
            people needed was a nutritional coach that also knew how to cook well. In response to these findings, the
            initial product idea was adjusted to better accommodate the need for nutritional education and support.

            <!-- <p>
              AI assistant functionality is based on the recent developments in language models such as chatGPT.
              It will assist in a variety of ways. Users can ask the AI assistant for vegan recipe ideas based on
              specific
              ingredients,
              dietary preferences, or cuisines. It will generate recipe recommendations and provide detailed
              instructions.
              Users will be able to inquire about the nutritional content of various foods, such as
              protein, vitamins, or minerals which will be helpful to both Valeria and Patrick.
            </p> -->
            <p>
              The feature emerged mid-project with ChatGPT's release. 
              The AI assistant provides recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, nutritional guidance, 
              vegan substitutes for favourite recipes, cooking tips tailored to experience level,
              and lifestyle advice on ethics and nutrition.

            Testing &amp; Iteration
          </h3>
          <p>
            I conducted usability tests with 4 participants matching my personas 2 vegans, 2 considering veganism. 
            Testing occurred in two rounds with design iterations between.

          </p>
          <p>
           Key findings and changes:
          <ol>
            <li>Moved barcode scanner, voice input, and search from top of screen to thumb-friendly 
              lower position based on feedback about uncomfortable reach
            </li>
            <li>
              Added back buttons to sign-up flow for revising choices
            </li>
            <li>Clarified pantry instructions
            </li>
            <li> Added intermittent fasting options and separated recipes by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <!-- <h3 class="challenge">
            Iterations
          </h3>
          <p>
            I made the followign changes to the initial design based on conducted user tests:
          <ol>
            <li>Based on feedback, I made adjustments to the initial design placement of the barcode scanner, voice
              input, and search bar. Initially, they were positioned at the top of the screen, but I moved them down
              to
              better accommodate user preferences and improve usability: "it's uncomfortable having to reach for the
              top of the screen".
            </li>
            <li>
              I incorporated back buttons into my designs, particularly in the sign-up process, as I noticed that
              users
              lacked the ability to revise their choices.
            </li>
            <li> I also added intermittent fasting as a dieting option and separated recepies by breakfast, lunch and
              dinner categories based on user feedback.
            </li>
            <li> The pantry step of the journey needed some additional instructions initially.
            </li>
            <li>
              To address some confusion, I took the feedback into account and renamed the buttons in the
              "create a meal plan" journey. This helped provide clearer indications of each step's purpose,
              making it easier for users to navigate through the prototype.
            </li>
          </ol>

              <p>
This speculative project allowed me to explore AI integration in behaviour change apps and practice end-to-end mobile UX design. 
Users responded positively to the comprehensive approach, particularly the AI assistant and seamless grocery integration. 
They appreciated the vibrant colour choices and found the features met their expectations.</p>
 <p> <br>
<strong>What I'd do differently:</strong> With only 4 test participants, validation was limited. 
A real product would require more extensive testing, particularly around the AI assistant's accuracy and nutritional tracking reliability. 
I'd also explore which features genuinely drive retention versus which are "nice-to-have," and investigate user requests for workout routines.</p>
 <p><br>
<strong>Key learning:</strong> User research fundamentally shifted my approach from "recipe app" to "nutritional coach." 
This reinforced the importance of interviewing users before designing solutions.
