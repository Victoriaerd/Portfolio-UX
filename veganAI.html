            To create a prototype for a mobile app based on design principles.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Having switched to vegan lifestyle over 7 years ago I found it extremely beneficial. When I was planning
            a case study for my UX portfolio a vegan app seemed like a natural idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial idea was to create a cooking app full of vegan recipes that would allow people to get inspiration
            along with ability to veganise their favourite recipes as they switched to a new lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project is to design a mobile application that helps users transition to a vegan lifestyle
            by providing educational resources, recepies and meal planning tools. The app aims to make the vegan
            lifestyle accessible and easy for people who are new to plant-based eating.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Design Goals: <br>
            The app should have a clean, modern design with an intuitive user interface. The colour palette should be
            bright and colorful, reflecting the natural vibrancy of plant-based foods. The design should be easy to use
            and accessible to people with a range of technical abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Figma and Photoshop for this project.

              I applied Design thinking as a problem-solving approach that emphasises empathy, creativity, and iterative
              prototyping. It consists of 5 phases: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototye &amp Test, and Refine &amp
              Improve.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              While I was familiar with the subject before conducting user interviews, I wanted to gain a deeper
              understanding of the topic and the existing products on the market. Research has shown the significant
              impact of agriculture on climate change, which motivated me to delve deeper into the subject.
              <br>
              Amanda Schupak who writes for The Guardian emphasises the importance of transitioning to sustainable,
              low-emissions diets, even if not fully vegan:
            <blockquote>
              "What we eat has an enormous environmental impact. Scientists estimate that food production causes 35%
              of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, with meat responsible for more than twice the pollution of
              fruits, grains and greens. In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report urged
              world leaders, especially those in developed countries, to support a transition to sustainable, healthy,
              low-emissions diets to help mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              A study by Marco Springmann suggests that transitioning to plant-based diets could reduce global mortality
              and food-related greenhouse gas emissions:
            <blockquote>
              "Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could
              reduce global mortality by 6-10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29-70% compared with a
              reference scenario in 2050."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              The above quotes emphasise the urgency of making changes to our food system to address the interconnected
              issues of climate change, health, and ecosystem degradation. The research highlighted the significant
              impact
              of food
              production and consumption on the environment and human health.
            </p>

            <h3 class="challenge">
              User Interviews
            </h3>

            <p>
              Given that the subject of veganism can be sensitive, I felt that interviews would allow me to ask
              follow-up questions and gain a more in-depth understanding of the audience's motivations and needs.
              I conducted semi-structured interviews both with vegans and people who are just curious about the subject.
              I selected a set of pre-determined topics that I knew would be relevant to my project, but also allowed
              for flexibility to explore new avenues and follow-up questions as they arose adapting to each person. The
              interviews provided me with a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in designing
              a successful vegan app.

              I used the following questions as a basis of the interviews.
            </p>
            <ol class="interview">
              <li>
                Motivations/ inspiration for considering vegan diet? If vegan motivation for staying vegan and
                inspiration
                when they first switched.

              <li>

              Personas
            </h3>
            <p>
              As part of my design process, I developed 2 personas to help me better understand and empathise with the
              target audience for the app. I wanted to target both people already familiar with the vegan lifestyle
              and
              users who are just considering to switch. I created detailed profiles and during user interviews I was
              able to gain valuable insights into their expectations, concerns, motivations, and behaviours. Valeria
              and
              Patrick served as a guide for the rest of the design process, helping me to keep the user's needs and
              goals at the forefront of my thinking.

            Key Findings
          </h3>
          <p>
            During the interviews it became clear that people really struggled with the luck of nutritional
            education when it came to the vegan diet. As one participant pointed out, "I almost had to become a
            nutritionist." People who were not yet vegan were concerned that their health would be impacted due to the
            lack of knowledge, with one saying, "it is too difficult, and I would struggle to eat well."
          </p>
          <p>
            While people had some knowledge of the vegan lifestyle and its environmental impact, it seemed that they
            didn't just want another recipe app, as people who were vegan were following influencers on Instagram and
            getting inspiration there, and omnivores had a few tried and tested recipes they cooked. Instead,what
            people needed was a nutritional coach that also knew how to cook well. In response to these findings, the
            initial product idea was adjusted to better accommodate the need for nutritional education and support.

            Competitive Analysis
          </h3>
          <p>
            I identified companies and products
            that are currently on the market and are aiming to help the transitioning to a vegan diet. I wanted to gain
            insights into existing solutions that aim to make the transition
            process more seamless and convenient.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assess the strengths and weaknesses of my competitors I compared
            their content, functionality, and overall user experience. I also looked into user reviews on the app store.
            This exercise enabled me to pinpoint areas of
            improvement and identify potential gaps in the market that my app could address effectively.

            A well-crafted problem statement will help me guide the design process by providing a clear and focused
            objective to work towards, while also addressing the needs and pain points of the target audience:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Many people tend to struggle to transition to a vegan lifestyle due to a lack of knowledge, resources, and
            support. My goal is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly app that provides guidance, education, and
            motivation to help users successfully adopt and most importantly maintain a vegan lifestyle in the long

            Colour
          </h3>
          <p>
            I picked the primary and secondary colours using colour picker tool in Figma from one of the images I
            downloaded
            earlier while workign on a mood board and doing competitor's research. The same image will be used for
            the main banner on the home page. I used blue as the primary colour as wanted my main tone to convey a sense
            of calm and trust. I selected yellow as secondary colour as it works well with blue being on the opposite
            side of the colour
            wheel. Yellow is happy, optimistic, and cheerful which I though will work well with a cycling brand.
            I also decided to use images of the bicycles on a black background as product shots and
            yellow colour will look good against black creating a strong contrast but also adding quite masculine look
            and work well for my UX Persona.
          </p>
          <p>
            To add an accent colour I used Adobe colours to select a compelling colour scheme, and added a pink colour
            as an accent. I then used Material Design’s colour tool to get a darker and a lighter shade of the blue and
            to check what will text look like against those colours to make sure it is legible. I also added a few grey
            shades with a touch of blue as well as slightly off-white colour and
            a black colour with a touch of blue.

            Typegraphy and Logo
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was looking for something quite bold and modern as a main font, something that would look equally good as
            a header and applied as a logo on a bicycle. As I came up with a name for the brand, I wanted it to start
            with a letter ‘E’ for e-bike and have a letter ‘U’ which I planned to turn into an electric plug. I named
            the brand Enu and typed its name to compare a few fonts side by side.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided on a monospace font as I wanted the letters to be equally spaced and was looking for a
            minimalist modern look.
          </p>
          <p>
            I selected Ubuntu font family as the font for headings and then looked for good font pairings. I then
            selected
            another sans-serif font for the body called Source Sans Pro. There’s an ongoing debate about whether serif
            or sans-serif fonts are best in terms of readability sans-serif fonts are often favoured for
            online/on-screen text due to their simplified letterforms that display more clearly at various screen
            resolutions.
            I then created font hierarchy using type scale tool and picked 1.250 Major third scale as a base, later on
            replacing some of the heading sizes to better suit my design as I worked through it.

            Accessibility
          </h3>
          <p>
            Colour Contrast Analyser app was used to test there’s a sufficient contrast between
            elements, it can help users with low vision or users in bright or dark light conditions use the website. I
            used the app to check the text but also various UI elements and made a series of adjustments.
            As a result of the tests, I added a stroke in Log in screens as the contrast ratio between the form fields
            and the
            background was not enough. I also added a shadow and a stroke to reviews cards.

          </p>
          <p>
            I used off-white colour as a background and not completely black but black with a touch of grey blue for
            text. Research suggests that less contrast in the case of black text on white background as well as white
            text on black background works better for accessibility as it reduces strain on the eyes
          </p>
          <p>
            To make sure icons in the menu are easy to click I used Frames around them that are 44x44px.
          </p>
          <p>
            After researching the best design for forms in terms of accessibility I added label text that is always
            visible and aligned with input line I also added error message field underneath alongside highlighting it
            with red.
          </p>
          <p>
            To check the pages were legible for colour blind people I used a plugin in Figma called Color Blind.

          <p>
            After the tests I made several changes:
          <ol>
            <li>I added reviews page as users reported they didn’t feel comfortable purchasing from a website without
              reviews.</li>
            <li>I also added more information about the individual features of the product, including a page about eco
              features since Leo, the Persona I was designing for was described as eco/environment/waste conscious.</li>
            <li>I also increased the size of the label that includes price tag as well as the labels that indicated more
              information was available for each of the features.</li>
          </ol>

            I further tested the prototype and while users where able to complete the task of purchase and felt like
            they could trust the website.

            View the prototype on Figma's platform or via the video.

            Logo Design
          </h3>
          <p>
            I created logo using 2 different font weights and 2 font sizes in Figma. I wanted the first letter to
            standout as an association with electric bicycles and letter ‘U’ to look like an eclectic plug. I have
            adjusted font
            weight for the ‘BIKE’ part to regular and made the rest of the letters bold. I then turned ‘ENU’ into a
            vector
            shape and aligned two rectangular shapes with letter ‘U’.
