          <h3 class="projects">
            To create a prototype for an engaging, user-friendly mobile experience for aspiring plant-based eaters
            that makes veganism approachable, enjoyable, and sustainable long-term.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The lifestyle shift to veganism can be daunting for many people, leading to frustrations. Having switched to
            the vegan lifestyle over 7 years ago I found there is a need for a supportive
            platform that provides educational resources, simplifies
            meal planning/shopping, and offers inspiration to help new vegans thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial idea was to create a cooking app full of vegan recipes that would allow people to get inspiration
            along with the ability to veganise their favourite recipes as they switched to a new lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is creating an app that simplifies veganism and sets users up for
            sustainable plant-based success.
          </p>

          <h3 class="projects">Design Goals: </h3>
          <p>
            The app should have a clean, modern design with an intuitive user interface. The colour palette should be
            bright and colorful, reflecting the natural vibrancy of plant-based foods. The design should be easy to use
            and accessible to people with a range of technical abilities.
          </p>

          <h3 class="projects">Tools: </h3>

            I used Figma, Premiere and Photoshop for this project.

              I applied Design thinking as a problem-solving approach that emphasises empathy, creativity, and iterative
              prototyping. It consists of 5 phases: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototye &amp Test, and Refine &amp

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              While I was familiar with the subject before conducting user interviews, I wanted to gain a deeper
              understanding of the topic and the existing products on the market. Research has shown the significant
              impact of agriculture on climate change, which motivated me to delve deeper into the subject.
              <br>
              Amanda Schupak who writes for The Guardian emphasises the importance of transitioning to sustainable,
              low-emissions diets, even if not fully vegan:
            <blockquote>
              "What we eat has an enormous environmental impact. Scientists estimate that food production causes 35%
              of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, with meat responsible for more than twice the pollution of
              fruits, grains and greens. In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report urged
              world leaders, especially those in developed countries, to support a transition to sustainable, healthy,
              low-emissions diets to help mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              A study by Marco Springmann suggests that transitioning to plant-based diets could reduce global mortality
              and food-related greenhouse gas emissions:
            <blockquote>
              "Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could
              reduce global mortality by 6-10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29-70% compared with a
              reference scenario in 2050."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              The above quotes emphasise the urgency of making changes to our food system to address the interconnected
              issues of climate change, health, and ecosystem degradation. The research highlighted the significant
              impact
              of food
              production and consumption on the environment and human health.
            </p>

            <h3 class="challenge">
              User Interviews
            </h3>

            <p>
              Given that the subject of veganism can be sensitive, I felt that interviews would allow me to ask
              follow-up questions and gain a more in-depth understanding of the audience's motivations and needs.
              I conducted semi-structured interviews both with vegans and people who are just curious about the subject.
              I selected a set of pre-determined topics that I knew would be relevant to my project, but also allowed
              for flexibility to explore new avenues and follow-up questions as they arose adapting to each person. The
              interviews provided me with a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in designing
              a successful vegan app.

              I used the following questions as a basis of the interviews.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol class="interview">
              <li>

          <p>
            As part of my design process, I developed 2 personas to help me better understand and empathise with the
            target audience for the app. I wanted to target both people already familiar with the vegan lifestyle
            and
            users who are just considering to switch. I created detailed profiles and during user interviews I was
            able to gain valuable insights into their expectations, concerns, motivations, and behaviours. Valeria
            and
            Patrick served as a guide for the rest of the design process, helping me to keep the user's needs and
            goals at the forefront of my thinking.

            Key Findings
          </h3>
          <p>
            During the interviews it became clear that people really struggled with the luck of nutritional
            education when it came to the vegan diet. As one participant pointed out, "I almost had to become a
            nutritionist." People who were not yet vegan were concerned that their health would be impacted due to the
            lack of knowledge, with one saying, "it is too difficult, and I would struggle to eat well."
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            While people had some knowledge of the vegan lifestyle and its environmental impact, it seemed that they
            didn't just want another recipe app, as people who were vegan were following influencers on Instagram and
            getting inspiration there, and omnivores had a few tried and tested recipes they cooked. Instead, what
            people needed was a nutritional coach that also knew how to cook well. In response to these findings, the
            initial product idea was adjusted to better accommodate the need for nutritional education and support.

              Competitive Analysis

            <p>
              I identified companies and products
              that are currently on the market and are aiming to help the transitioning to a vegan diet. I wanted to
              gain
              insights into existing solutions that aim to make the transition
              process more seamless and convenient.

            <p>
              To assess the strengths and weaknesses of my competitors I compared
              their content, functionality, and overall user experience. I also looked into user reviews on the app
              store.
              This exercise enabled me to pinpoint areas of
              improvement and identify potential gaps in the market that my app could address effectively.

              I used affinity map as a visual tool for brainstorming and organising information. It helped me to make
              sense of the data gathered in research, insights from the interviews, and ideas by grouping related
              concepts
              or themes together to come up with solutions and features for my target audience. The process involved
              capturing pain points or insights from the user interviews and then organising them based on their natural
              relationships or a common theme.

              Features prioritisation
            </h3>
            <p>
              After conducting research, interviews and analysis, I developed a comprehensive list of solutions and
              features tailored to address the pain points identified among the target audience. Throughout this
              process,
              I referenced the personas I had previously created to ensure alignment with their needs and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              To prioritise the features, I utilised a chart that considered the potential impact and level of effort
              required for implementation. Emphasising high impact and low effort, as well as high impact and high
              effort,
              took precedence over features with low impact and high effort.

            <p>
              During the course of this case study, an exciting development emerged with the introduction of ChatGPT, an
              advanced AI assistant. This breakthrough created an opportunity to enhance the app by incorporating a
              vegan
              AI
              assistant capable of answering user queries regarding nutrition, supplementation, recipe suggestions, and
              providing guidance throughout their transition to a vegan diet. An integration with ChatGPT or a similar

              IA serves as the backbone of the app, ensuring that users can effortlessly access and

              The initial focus was on the sign-up process, aiming to create a user-friendly and comprehensive
              experience.
              This would allow users to create personalised plans based on their fitness goals, dietary restrictions,
              food
              preferences, dislikes, as well as important factors like gender, age, and activity levels. Different
              levels
              of cooking were taken into account to accomodate different abilities
              for Patrick and Valeria. The goal was to
              gather detailed information to ensure the app could provide tailored recommendations and support for each

            <p>
              I then created a comprehensive meal planning feature for the app.
              This included a diverse range of recipes, a convenient pantry section that allowes users to input
              ingredients through voice commands, and intuitive search filters to cater to individual dietary needs.
              Additionally, I added a scheduling functionality, enabling users to easily integrate the
              meal plans into their personal calendars. These features were designed to enhance user convenience and
              provide a seamless experience in meal planning and organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app's robust filtering system empowers Patrick to select a meal that perfectly suits his special
              occasion, ensuring a memorable dining experience. On the other hand, Valeria can effortlessly identify
              the
              most nutritious options that align with her dietary preferences and goals. The app enables users to make
              the
              most of their pantry ingredients, minimising food waste and promoting
              sustainability. Taking it a step further, the integration of an AI assistant will provide invaluable

              AI assistant functionality is based on the recent developments in language models such as chatGPT.
              It will assist in a variety of ways. Users can ask the AI assistant for vegan recipe ideas based on
              specific
              ingredients,
              dietary preferences, or cuisines. It will generate recipe recommendations and provide detailed
              instructions.
              Users will be able to inquire about the nutritional content of various foods, such as
              protein, vitamins, or minerals which will be helpful to both Valeria and Patrick.
            </p>
            <p>
              Patricks can also ask the AI assistant for vegan substitutes for his favourite non-vegan ingredients in
              his favourite recipes to help with his transition. The AI can also offer guidance on how to achieve
              similar
              flavours and textures. It can offer cooking tips and techniques specifically tailored to
              vegan cooking, as well as user's cooking expertise level making it easier for someone who is just
              switching
              to vegan lifestyle.
              Users are able to get advice and guidance on various aspects of the lifestyle:
              ethical considerations, environmental impact, plant-based nutrition all

              The nutritional breakdown is provided for each meal as well as the summary of the user's overall nutrient
              intake.
              I decided to integrate a barcode scanner functionality that allows users to add any additional foods. This
              feature can automatically retrieve nutritional information from a database.
              Users will also be able to customise and create recipes from scratch. Provided visual representations

            <li>Based on feedback, I made adjustments to the initial design placement of the barcode scanner, voice
              input, and search bar. Initially, they were positioned at the top of the screen, but I moved them down
              to
              better accommodate user preferences and improve usability: "it's uncomforbotable having to reach for the
              top of the screen".
            </li>
            <li>
              I incorporated back buttons into my designs, particularly in the sign-up process, as I noticed that
              users
              lacked the ability to revise their choices.
            </li>
            <li> I also added intermittent fasting as a dieting option and separated recepies by breakfast, lunch and
              dinner categories based on user feedback.

            I used off-white colour as a background and not completely black but black with a touch of grey blue for
            text. Research suggests that less contrast in the case of black text on white background as well as white
            text on black background works better for accessibility as it reduces strain on the eyes
          </p>
