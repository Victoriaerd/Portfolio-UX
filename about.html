          <h2 class="about-me">
            Hi, I am a Multidisciplinary UX Designer who understands the basics of HTML and CSS, with a
            background in Photography, Videography and Economics.
          </h2>
          <p>
            While being fascinated with all aspects of User Experience design,
            I am passionate about research, storytelling, and visual design.
            Accessibility and inclusive design are very important to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked on projects that involved visual re-branding, UX design, 3D
            models and 360 CGI renders delivery and content creation for
            start-ups as well as established brands.
          </p>
          <p>My current home is London, UK.</p>
          <p>
            I enjoy collaborating on initiatives that cross disciplinary
            boundaries. If you'd like to work with me, please get in touch.
          </p>
        </div> -->
        <div class="grid-item-2"><h2 class="about-me">
        I'm a UX designer based in London, specialising in research-driven design for e-commerce and complex digital tools.</h2>
        
        <p>Over the past decade, I've worked with organisations ranging from Heal's and the National Theatre to Diageo and the British Council, creating visual content and digital experiences that connect with audiences. For the past few years, I've focused specifically on UX research and interaction design.</p>

        
        <p>My approach centres on understanding people first. I conduct user research - interviews, usability testing, analytics analysis -
          to uncover the problems worth solving. 
          Then I design solutions that balance user needs with business objectives and technical feasibility.</p>
        
      <h2 class="about-me">Recent projects include:</h2>
        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Redesigning Heal's product pages to improve discoverability and conversion</li> <br>
            <li>Creating an internal transcription tool for FreeUK Genealogy volunteers</li><br>
            <li>Developing AI-assisted mobile experiences for behaviour change</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I'm particularly drawn to projects where accessibility matters,
           and where design decisions need to be evidence-based rather than assumption-driven.</p>

        <h2 class="about-me">An unconventional path</h2>
        
        <p>Before UX, I spent years as a photographer and videographer, leading visual content strategy at Heal's and documenting performances at the National Theatre. 
          Before that, I worked in corporate finance working on cross-border transactions.</p>
        
        <p>This diverse background gives me a useful perspective: 
          I understand business metrics and ROI (the economics degree), visual storytelling and brand consistency (the photography years), 
          and how to translate complex requirements into intuitive experiences (the UX work).</p>

        <h2 class="about-me">Skills and tools</h2>
        
        <div class="skills-section">
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> User interviews, usability testing, journey mapping, analytics (Google Analytics), heuristic evaluation</p>
            <p><strong>Design:</strong> Figma, Miro, prototyping, design systems, accessibility</p>
            <p><strong>Development:</strong> HTML/CSS for prototyping and collaboration with engineers</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Photography, videography, Adobe Creative Suite, 3D/CGI project management</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="about-me">Currently</h2>
        
        <p>I'm open to mid-level UX positions where I can contribute to thoughtful, research-driven design and continue growing alongside talented teams.</p>
